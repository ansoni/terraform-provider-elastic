# terraform-provider-elastic

A Terraform Provider for Elastic.co products (Elasticsearch, Kibana, etc).  Please test and provide feedback and examples of things that don't work.  Most of these work along the lines of taking in a raw body output of a Kibana SavedObject.  From their, we modify it with supplied variables which are typically the primary keys of index-patterns, visualizations, etc.  Our goal is to one day be able to create objects without requiring a body at all.

# Build

	go get
	go build

# Install

	cp terraform-provider-elastic ~/.terraform.d/plugins/	

# Run Example

	cd example
	docker-compose up
	bash load_data.sh
	terraform init
	terraform apply

You should have a whole bunch of visualizations built off of the Shakespeare example.  

# Generic Saved-Object

Supported Types:  timelion-sheet, index-pattern, search, visualization, dashboard

Use a template to modify a SavedSearch Attributes item.  The attributes field should refence the attributes field inside of a saved_objects api Get request. 

	data "template_file" "timelion" {
		template = <<EOF
	{
	   "timelion_interval" : "auto",
	   "timelion_columns" : 2,
	   "timelion_chart_height" : 275,
	   "hits" : 0,
	   "description" : "",
	   "timelion_sheet" : [
	      ".es(*).abs()"
	   ],
	   "version" : 1,
	   "timelion_rows" : 2,
	   "title" : "$${title}"
	}
	EOF
		vars {
			title = "rar"
		}
	}
	
	resource "elastic_kibana_saved_object" "test" {
		attributes = "${data.template_file.timelion.rendered}"
		saved_object_type = "timelion-sheet"
		name = "awesome"
		description = "w00t"
	}

outputs

id
saved_object_type
title 

# Generic Saved-Object-Content

More advanced Dashboards in Kibana have deep-link to dashboards within visualizations within the Dashboard.  This creates a "chicken and the egg"/circular dependency where we need to know the dashboard id before it has been created.

In the previous example, you would remove the attributes field and could deploy it later in your terraform with this snippet:

	resource "elastic_kibana_saved_object_content" "test" {
                attributes = "${data.template_file.timelion.rendered}"
                saved_object_type = "${elastic_kibana_saved_object.test.saved_object_type}"
                saved_object_id = "${elastic_kibana_saved_object.test.id}"
        }
